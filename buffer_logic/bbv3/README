This is my first attempt at bundling some files together for the Bus Blaster V3, hopefully i'm not duplicating or infringing on someone else's efforts.

All of this is based entirely on the BBv2 and limited BBv3 code found in the svn:
https://code.google.com/p/dangerous-prototypes-open-hardware/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FBus_Blaster%2Fbuffer_logic%253Fstate%253Dclosed

files:
bbv3.ucf - constraints based on pin mapping of bbv3
passthrough.v - verilog to pass through jtag signals and make the BB work like a ftdi cable
jtagkey.v - verilog to emulate the jtagkey logic and enables

for each ucf/v combination there's a separate folder that includes the xilinx ise project and the impact project.
for each ucf/v combo there's also an svf that has been tested with urjtag

I'll try to port and test a couple more buffer logics, and try and keep the version specifics in the ucf.

Tested with:
Ubuntu 12.04.3 64bit
libftdi (sudo apt-get install libftdi1)
urJtag v0.10 (sudo apt-get install urjtag)

To write and use the passthrough logic:
jtag> cable ft2232 pid=0x6010 vid=0x0403 interface=1
jtag> detect
jtag> svf bbv3-passthrough.svf stop progress
jtag> cable ft2232 pid=0x6010 vid=0x0403
jtag> detect
jtag> svf ....

To write and use the jtagkey logic:
jtag> cable ft2232 pid=0x6010 vid=0x0403 interface=1
jtag> detect
jtag> svf bbv3-passthrough.svf stop progress
jtag> cable jtagkey pid=0x6010 vid=0x0403
jtag> detect
jtag> svf ....
